                  <p> The bottom line is, I can help you regardless of if you're just starting or you already have a business. I believe Shopify is the solution for you. I also believe experience and knowledge are invaluable and I have both. You can see for youself here, I run <a href="https://underthestarsclothing.co.uk/password"><b><u>Underthestars Clothing</u></b></a> a small but successful onlne store that I built using Shopify (Feel free to have look around and pick up something if you like what you see!). You could have something similar if you choose to work with myself.</p>
                  <p>Now I bet you have probably read all this and thought to yourself, if its that easy why can't i do it? And youre absolutely right, you can. But I have already done all the hardwork for you. Depending on the size and what the business is, I could have your site up and running in as little as 5-7 days. Feel free to contact me and we can discuss timeframe in detail along with pricing.
