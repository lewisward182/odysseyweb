        <h2 class="main-about-heading">About Me</h2>
        <h4 class="main-about-text"><p>I'm Lewis, I am a freelance Front-End Web Designer/Developer. I'm based just outside of Glasgow, Scotland, UK. I have used the name Odysseyweb as my brand name as I thought it was better than using my actual name, how many lewises do you know?</p>
          <p>I started coding at the age of 16 and I'm now 24, I'm getting old! I have always been interested in Front-end Development since I first learned about it and it led me to attend Glasgow Clyde College for Web Engineering which I thoroughly enjoyed and I learned a lot. From how to use frameworks, version management, hosting, development, design, UI, UX, team management, the list feels endless.</p>
          <p>Now to get to the year 2022 I have decided I finally wish to pursue my dream of becoming a Freelance Front-End Developer. Although I am not taking clients just now, I hope you keep me in mind for the near future as on my side there’s still a couple of things I need to iron out before I go live – but the fact you’re here reading this anyway is great!</p>

          <h2 class="main-about-heading">Why should you choose me?</h2>

          <h4 class="main-about-text"><p>There are many benefits for being Freelance, working for myself and being in total control of the end product along with quite a few for yourself, the client. It means we can have a more personal relationship while working together. The level of communication from working with myself compared to an angency or a larger company (in my opinion cannot be beaten). I can have more time with yourself and keep you updated throughout the entire design and development process.</p>
          <p>I can help you. Sometimes we don’t always have exactly what we want in mind, it can be difficult to visualize and sometimes it can change over time. I am more than happy to work with you regarding the design side of things, and give my professional advice on what I think will work and what wont, but that's entirely up to yourself as ultimtely its your decision. For example I can help choose out a certain color scheme or font that I think would go best with your requirements along with picking up the perfect images for what you need.</p>
          <p>I can design what you need and make sure it looks modern and professional for your needs, nobody wants a site looking like its straight out of the 90’s...Right!? Whether you need a simple landing page or a product release page or you're the owner of a cafe,restraunt or bar? Maybe you even run a small business and requre a site to market yourself to potential clients? I am here to help.</h4>

        <h2 class="faq-h2"><u>FAQ</u></h2>
        <p><b>Pricing</b> -  Pricing will be discussed after we discuss what your needs are. I require a £40 deposit at the beginning (£40 goes towards the final cost) and then once you are happy with the end product final payment will be taken.<br></p>
        <p><b>Time</b> -  Depending on what your needs are for timescale I will always aim to get it done in under 20 days. With that being said if we have an agreed deadline and I go over it, I will offer a discount on the final price.<br></p>
        <p><b>Location</b> -  I'm currently operating out of Glasgow, Scotland. If you're local we could always meet up and discuss in person if you wish.<br></p>
        <p><b>Clients</b> -  At the moment I will only take on projects that are relatively small in size - With that being said I would still appreciate if you dropped me a message to see what I can do.<br></p>
        <p><b>Contact</b> -  You can contact me via the contact section on the home page.<br></p>
